        <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <p>Bread is a staple and one of the oldest foods prepared from a dough of flour(usually <strong>wheat</strong>) and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history and around the world, it has been an important part of many cultures' diet. Bread is a major source of complex carbohydrates and B vitamins (especially when whole wheat is used).Bread has not only sustained us physically but also played an essential role in both religious rituals and secular culture throughout human history</p>

        <P>Evidence from 30,000 years ago in Europe and Australia revealed starch residue on rocks used for pounding plants. Primitive flatbreads may have been made by spreading starch extract from plant roots (such as cattails and ferns) on a flat rock and cooking it over a fire. Around 10,000 BC, with the dawn of the Neolithic age and the spread of agriculture, grains became the mainstay for making bread. Yeast spores are ubiquitous, so any dough left to rest leavens naturally.</P>
