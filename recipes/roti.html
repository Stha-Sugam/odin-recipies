        <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <p>Roti, also known as chapati, is a round flatbread native to the Indian subcontinent. It is widely consumed in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, Caribbean, and Southeast African countries.Roti is made from stoneground whole wheat flour, traditionally known as <em>gehu ka atta</em>, and water. These two simple ingredients are combined into a dough. The word “roti” is derived from the Sanskrit word roṭikā, meaning “bread” 1. Whether paired with cooked vegetables, curries, or used as a carrier for other dishes, roti remains a staple accompaniment in various cuisines.</p>

        <p>There are many variants of rotis across the globe. Many cultures worldwide have their own variations of flatbreads similar to roti, from Africa to Oceania to the Malay Peninsula.Some of the variants of rotis are as follows. Chapati: Made of whole-wheat flour (atta), mixed into a dough with water, edible oil, and optional salt. It is cooked on a tava. Tandoori Roti: Cooked by sticking the flattened dough to the inside wall of a tandoor oven, where it bakes quickly at a high temperature.Paratha: A flaky, layered version of roti, often brushed with ghee or oil during cooking. Naan: Unlike roti, naan is yeast-leavened and typically thicker.</p>
